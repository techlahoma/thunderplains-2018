            <p>Learning web development from scratch can be a daunting task. In addition to programming languages, there are all kinds of tools it seems you need to master just to get started: bundlers, taskrunners, package managers, transpilers&hellip; when and how did web development get to be so complicated? In this talk, we'll follow the evolution of a web page through time, introducing it to technical obstacles and innovations until we arrive at present day. We'll come away with a better appreciation for the problems our modern tools solve, and historical context for how the field has evolved.</p>

          <div class="content">
            <p>Intermittent internet connection is something many people in the United States face, and it’s a huge hurdle to complete simple tasks like finding a bank balance – or even more important tasks like searching for employment.</p>

        <p>Service workers can help by caching assets like HTML pages, images and even JavaScript files within the user’s browser. Once the assets are cached, the browser will load directly from the cache making the entire loading process faster. Even better, because the assets are already in the browser, the page will load without an Internet connection!</p>

        <p>This talk will introduce service workers, explore use cases, and teach the audience how to implement service workers in their apps. We’ll also learn about other great features of service workers like background sync and push notifications.</p>

Secondly it is about Phaser 3, the latest-and-greatest framework for achieving your videogame goals in Javascript. Thirdly it is about my experience working on a boilerplate and scaffold to bring all these ideas into an Open Source project so anyone can make their own game in Javascript!</p>

        <p>That just the groundwork! The last part of the talk is the best part! With these three things we&#39;re then going to mix it up and explore some of the more interesting techniques for game creation such as procedural level generation, AI randomness, Behavior Trees, rules engines for Tilemaps and more!</p>

            <p>Every application, no matter what framework that you use needs a really solid centralized store. This helps to maintain state and persist data back into your systems.

There are 5 main database families. In this talk we’ll survey all 5: Relational (SQL), Key/Value (NoSQL), Columnar (NoSQL), Document (NoSQL), and Graph (NoSQL). We’ll cover what scenarios each family handles well. In addition, we’ll discuss the most popular members of each family. So, the next time you need to pick a database, you’ll know which one - or ones - are the best fit.</p>

            <p>My wife and I wanted to build a mobile app to make growing food easier, so we started learning how to code last year. We released our app at the end of the year and are now the #1 search result for &quot;growing food&quot; in the App Store with over 50,000 downloads and 10,000 monthly active users. This talk explains how we learned to code, built the app, and share the marketing strategies we used to climb to the top of the app store!</p>
